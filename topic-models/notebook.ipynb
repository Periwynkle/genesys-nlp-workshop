    "# Topic Modeling - An Empirical Approach to Theme Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "[*Folgert Karsdorp*](https://github.com/fbkarsdorp)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this session we will employ an unsupervised model of text, one which often goes under the name 'Topic Model', to explore and make visible thematic aspects in the K-Pop comments dataset. Topic Models, or more precisely, mixed-membership models, have gained a lot of popularity as a method for identifying and organizing topical and thematic structures in text documents and text corpora (see e.g. Blei et al. 2003,  Griffiths & Steyvers 2004). The goal of this session is to introduce the very basics of Topic Models, and, subsequently, to show how Python can be employed to apply Topic Models to the K-Pop dataset. Ignoring any mathematical details, this introduction will primarily focus on the implementation and execution of Topic Models in Python, allowing us to concentrate on the interpretation, evaluation and visualization of the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "This session is structured as follows. We will first give a brief introduction into the general concepts underlying Topic Modeling. In the subsequent sections, we will work our way through (i) the necessary steps to implement a Topic Model in Python and apply it to the K-Pop dataset, and (ii) the means of evaluating and visualizing the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Topic Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following five mini-documents:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. I have tests that I should be studying for but nope, BTS is more important.\n",
    "2. I really love all these BTS it looks really fun. Makes me want to be a K-Pop idol.\n",
    "3. Lisa is the cutiest I love her so much üòçüòçüòçüòçüòç\n",
    "4. The camera absolutely loves Lisa.\n",
    "5. I'm like super late because I never really watch BTS of music videos so how come they fast forward Lisa's rap?\n",
    "\n",
    "Topic Modeling is essentially a technique to automatically discover 'topics' in these documents (i.e. without utilizing any knowledge except their words). For instance, a Topic Model might discover that documents 1 and 2 are about BTS and K-Pop (Topic 1), whereas documents 3 and 4 are about Lisa from the group Blackpink and how lovable she is (Topic 2). Document 5, then, appears to be a mixture of these two topics. Note that topics are represented as distributions over a vocabulary. For example, Topic 1 could be represented as '50% BTS, 30% K-Pop, 10% videos ...', and Topic 2 as '47% Lisa, 35% love, 4% üòç, ...'. There are various methods to perform Topic Modeling. In what follows, we will discuss and employ the well-known technique 'Latent Dirichlet Allocation' or LDA for short.\n",
    "\n",
    "Latent Dirichlet Allocation is a so-called *generative model*, which specifies a procedure with which documents are written. LDA has the following naive assumption about how to write a text:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Choose the number of words $N$ in your document;\n",
    "2. Choose a topic mixture $\\theta$ for your document (e.g., 60% about Topic 1 and 40% about Topic 2);\n",
    "3. While the number of generated words is smaller than N, generate a word $w_i$ by:\n",
    "    1. choosing a topic according to the chosen topic mixture $\\theta$;\n",
    "    2. choosing a word according the topic's distribution over the vocabulary.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to this procedure, we might write (or generate) a text as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We choose our document to be 4 words long;\n",
    "2. 25% of the document will be about Topic 1 and 75% about Topic 2;\n",
    "3. By choosing words from Topic 1 and Topic 2, we generate four words: Lisa (T2), love (T2), videos (T1), üòç (T2).\n",
    "\n",
    "If it wasn't already, it should be clear by now that LDA has a completely unrealistic view on how documents are created. For example, it completely ignores all syntax and basically treats documents as bags of words. Yet, LDA's generative writing assumption is an explicit and powerful one, which, once reversed, enables us -- at least to a certain extent -- to *infer* topic mixtures and their associated words.\n",
    "\n",
    "A well-known inference technique is the **collapsed Gibbs sampler** (as discussed in, e.g., Griffiths & Steyvers 2004). Leaving any technicalities aside and glossing over many details, this technique works as follows. Given a collection of documents, we aim to estimate their topic mixtures and the words associated with each topic. First we need to hypothesize how many topics $K$ are in the collection. Subsequently we go over all words in each individual document and randomly(!) assign it to one of the $K$ topics. Note that this random assignment of words to topics already provides us with a topic mixtures and topic-word distribution, though, needless to say, their quality leaves much to be desired. The remaining steps of the procedure aim to improve this initial assignment by iterating over the documents, and for each word $w_i$ in a particular document $d_i$ we compute (i) the proportion with which it occurs with each of the $K$ topics (i.e. $p(w_i | t_i)$, and (ii) the proportion of words in a document assigned to each of the $K$ topics (i.e. $p(t_i | d_i)$). Subsequently, we choose a new topic for $w_i$ with probability $p(w_i | t_i) * p(t_i | d_i)$. By repeating this procedure for a large number of trials, the assignments will slowly improve, thus reflecting a better topic mixture of the documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the remainder of this tutorial, we will apply Topic Modeling to the K-pop dataset. Before that we first need to discuss some essential data preprocessing steps for data representation. This will be the topic of the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "As stated above, Topic Models operate on the word level and ignore the linear ordering of words in documents. As such, all we need to know is how often each word in the collection occurs in each document. An efficient data representation capturing this information is the so-called **bag-of-words model**, in which documents are represented as histograms over the vocabulary (i.e. we list for each word type in the collection how often it occurs in a particular document). A collection of bag-of-words is called a vector-space model. The Machine Learning library scikit-learn provides efficient procedures to construct this representation on the basis of raw text files. In the following code block, we first construct a list containing the paths to all text files in the corpus. For reasons that will be clear in a moment, we subsequently shuffle this list randomly."

    "Scikit-learn's `feature_extraction.text` module provides a `CountVectorizer` object with which collections of text documents can easily be converted into a vector space model. In the code block below, we first import the module under the alias `text`. Subsequently, we initialize an instance of `CountVectorizer`. The `CountVectorizer` specifies a wide range of arguments enabling developers to tune the vectorizer to their own needs. Here, we specify the following four arguments. First, we set the input to be a list of filenames, from which the raw contents will be fetched during the vectorization process. Second, the `min_df` argument specifies a the minimum document frequency of terms to be included in the model. All terms that occur in less documents than the value given to `min_df` will be ignored. The third argument specifies a custom regular expression to be used for tokenizing the raw text documents into word tokens. Note that we are only interested in terms with at least three characters. Finally, to remove highly frequent and often less informative words from the model, we specify to ignore all terms present in the English stopword list of Scikit-Learn. After initializing the vectorizer, the method `fit_transform` is called to transform the K-pop comment collection into a document-term matrix, in which rows represent documents and columns the vocabulary of the collection. Individual cells, then, represent the frequency with which particular words occur in specific documents."
